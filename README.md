Webhooks are valuable tools for powering real-time integrations and workflows in your project’s existing tools. This session will walk through an approach of building a webhook-powered application that acts on events as they take place on GitHub. You will also learn how to use the GitHub REST API through the Octokit SDK to call for additional resources after receiving an event.
